### Chapter Directory Naming

Chapters use the pattern `{PG-section}-{topic}`:
- `208-arrests` = Patrol Guide Section 208
- `318-disciplinary-matters` = Administrative Guide Section 318
- 200-series = Operations chapters
- 300-series = Personnel & Administration chapters

### Content File Formats

**Section files** (`section-NNN-topic.md`):
- Markdown with PG procedure numbers as headings
- Blockquote callouts for exam content (`> **Exam Alert:**`)
- Tables for role comparisons and procedure summaries
- Bold/italic for emphasis on testable distinctions ("shall" vs "should" vs "may")

**Review questions** (`review-questions.md`):
- Questions with `**N. question text**` format
- Options as `- A) option text`
- Answers in collapsible `<details><summary>Answer</summary>` blocks

**Key terms** (`key-terms.md`):
- Markdown table format: `| Term | Definition | Reference |`

---

## Commands Reference

See [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md) for the full command reference including:
- Build commands (`build`, `build:web`, `build:pdf`, `build:flutter`)
- Test & validate (`npm test`)
- Deploy (`npm run deploy`)
- Study tools (`export:anki`, `generate-quiz`, `schedule`, `study`)

## Build System

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Pandoc** (for PDF/HTML generation only)

### Quick Start

```bash
npm run build        # Generate all output
npm run build:web    # Fast rebuild for web app (data.js only)
npm test             # Run 23-test automated suite
```

### Build Pipeline

```
chapters/**/*.md ──> build-web.js ──> build/data.js ──> docs/data.js
                 ──> build-pdf.sh ──> build/study-guide-combined.md
                                  ──> build/study-guide.html
                                  ──> build/master-practice-exam.html
                                  ──> build/quick-reference-cheat-sheet.html
```

`build-web.js` does the heavy lifting:
1. Reads all 28 chapter directories in PG section order
2. Parses README, section files, key terms, and review questions
3. Extracts multiple-choice questions from markdown (supports 3 different question formats)
4. Parses the master practice exam with 4-column answer key (answer, source, explanation)
5. Outputs everything as `window.STUDY_DATA = {...}` in data.js

---

## Testing

The test suite (`scripts/test-app.js`) runs 23 automated tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Test Categories

**Data structure** — Validates chapters array, required fields, section content, question format

**Question integrity** — Checks for valid answer letters, no duplicate question numbers, options present

**Enrichment verification** — Confirms exam callouts are present in all enriched chapters

**Mnemonic verification** — Checks that key mnemonics (CAT PAC, MODULAR, FOUL FRAP, etc.) exist in the correct chapters

**HTML validation** — Verifies DOCTYPE, script/style tag balance, service worker registration, manifest reference

**Exam questions** — Validates all 140 exam questions have text, answer, options, and explanations

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages from the `docs/` directory on the main branch.

### Deploy Process

```bash
npm run build        # Generate fresh data.js
npm run test         # Verify everything passes
npm run deploy       # Copy src/ + build/data.js to docs/
git add docs/
git commit -m "deploy: update study guide"
git push
```

GitHub Pages automatically picks up changes to `docs/` on push. Updates are live within 1-2 minutes.

### iPhone Setup

1. Open the URL in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (box with arrow)
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app launches fullscreen with offline support

## How It Was Built

This project was built in phases using Claude Code as the primary development tool.

### Phase 1: PDF Extraction and Chapter Scaffolding

1. **Set up project structure** — Created 28 chapter directories matching PG section numbers (200-series for Operations, 300-series for Personnel/Admin)
2. **Extract text from PDFs** — Used OCR'd versions of pguide1 and pguide4 (scanned images). Pguide2 and pguide3 were already text-selectable
3. **Build chapter READMEs** — Each chapter got a README.md with title, source PDF reference, learning objectives, and links to section files
4. **Create section files** — Broke each PG section into focused study topics. For example, Chapter 208 (Arrests) became 9 section files covering law/processing, DAT, domestic violence, search guidelines, special arrests, etc.
5. **Write key terms** — Created key-terms.md for each chapter with vocabulary, definitions, and acronyms in table format
6. **Write review questions** — Created review-questions.md with multiple-choice questions using `<details>` tags for collapsible answers

### Phase 2: The Key Integration (24 Lessons)

Each of the 24 Key lessons was integrated one at a time into the matching chapter:

1. **Read the lesson PDF** — Extract exam alerts, mnemonics, prior test references, and PG conflicts
2. **Enrich existing section files** — Insert callouts at the relevant location in each section using blockquote format (`> **Exam Alert:**`, `> **Memory Aid —**`, etc.)
3. **Add new content** — Where The Key covered procedures not yet in the study guide, create new sections or expand existing ones
4. **Update review questions** — Add questions targeting The Key's exam focus areas
5. **Update key terms** — Add new mnemonics and acronyms to the terms table

This process was repeated for all 24 lessons across 20 chapters, producing 1,331 callouts total.

### Phase 3: Build System and Web App

1. **Build `build-web.js`** — Node.js script that reads all chapter directories, parses review questions from markdown, and generates a single `data.js` file containing all study content as JSON
2. **Build `build-pdf.sh`** — Bash script that concatenates all markdown files in chapter order and runs Pandoc to generate a combined study guide HTML with table of contents
3. **Create the web app** — Single-page application in `src/index.html` (HTML + CSS + JS, no framework) with:
   - Custom markdown-to-HTML renderer with callout detection
   - Chapter navigation with sidebar
   - Quiz engine with scoring and progress tracking
   - 140-question practice exam with timed mode
   - Flashcard viewer for key terms
   - Search across all content
   - Dark mode, adjustable font size
   - Service worker for offline access
4. **Create `package.json`** — Added npm scripts for `build`, `build:web`, `build:pdf`, `test`, and `deploy`

### Phase 4: Master Practice Exam

1. **Write 140 questions** — Multiple-choice questions covering all PG sections, weighted by exam importance
2. **Create answer key** — 4-column table with question number, correct answer, PG/AG source reference, and explanation
3. **Update parser** — Extended `parsePracticeExam()` in build-web.js to extract explanations from the 4-column format
4. **Build exam UI** — Timed exam mode with question navigation, answer selection, submission, and detailed results with per-question explanations

### Phase 5: Styling and iPhone Optimization

1. **Color-coded callouts** — Each callout type gets a distinct color:
   - Exam Alert: yellow/amber
   - Memory Aid: green
   - Prior Test: blue
   - PG Conflict: red
   - See Also: purple
   - Sergeant Focus: inverted black/white
2. **Typography** — Playfair Display for headings, Source Serif 4 for body, JetBrains Mono for UI elements
3. **Dark mode** — Full dark theme with adjusted contrast ratios
4. **Table striping** — Alternating row backgrounds for readability
5. **iPhone PWA optimization**:
   - `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` for fullscreen home screen mode
   - Safe area insets for notch and home indicator
   - 44px minimum touch targets (Apple HIG compliance)
   - Horizontal table scroll on mobile
   - Disabled tap highlight for native feel

### Phase 6: Testing and Polish

1. **Built test suite** (`scripts/test-app.js`) — 23 automated tests covering:
   - Data structure validation (chapters, sections, questions)
   - Question integrity (valid answers, no duplicates)
   - HTML structure (matched tags, required elements)
   - Enrichment verification (callouts present in expected chapters)
   - Mnemonic verification (key mnemonics present in data)
2. **Cross-reference audit** — Verified all "See Also" references point to valid PG sections
3. **Formatting consistency** — Standardized all README headings to `# Section NNN — Title`
4. **Removed generated files from git** — Added `build/` and `progress/` to .gitignore
5. **Project reorganization** — Moved web source to `src/`, renamed `output/` to `build/`, cleaned up dead files

### Phase 7: Deployment

1. **GitHub Pages** — Configured to serve from `docs/` directory on main branch
2. **Deploy script** — `npm run deploy` copies `src/` and `build/data.js` into `docs/`
3. **Service worker** — Caches index.html, data.js, and manifest.json for offline use
4. **PWA manifest** — Enables "Add to Home Screen" on mobile devices
